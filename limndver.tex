\section{Completeness respecting verification}

Completeness under many-one reductions in nondeterministic complexity classes fails in differentiating problems with different verification complexity.
Consider the satisfiability problem for Boolean circuits, for Boolean formulas, and for 3-CNF Boolean formulas.
Each problem can be solved by nondeterministically choosing an input $x$ of $n$ bits, where $n$ is the number of variables in the circuit or formula, then verifying whether the input $x$ satisfies the circuit or formula.
However, each verification process has vastly different computational complexity: evaluating a circuit is a $\P$-complete problem, evaluating a Boolean formula is an $\NC^1$-complete problem, and evaluating a 3-CNF Boolean formula is an $\AC^0$ problem.
Contrast this with the fact that each of the original decision problems is well-known to be $\NP$-complete (and even complete for $\NP$ under logarithmic space many-one reductions).

\subsection{Reductions respecting verification complexity}

Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be decision problems with corresponding witness relations $R_1$ and $R_2$.
There is a \emph{many-one reduction} from $L_1$ to $L_2$, denoted $L_1 \leq_m L_2$, if there is a computable function $f$ such that $x \in L_1$ if and only if $f(x) \in L_2$.
There is a \emph{weak Levin reduction} from $L_1$ to $L_2$, denoted $L_1 \leq_w L_2$, if $L_1 \leq_m L_2$ and $R_1 \leq_m R_2$.
There is a \emph{Levin reduction} from $L_1$ to $L_2$, denoted $L_1 \leq_L L_2$, if there are computable functions $f$, $g$, and $h$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $(x, w) \in R_1$, then $(f(x), g(x, w)) \in R_2$,
\item if $(f(x), w') \in R_2$, then $(x, h(x, w')) \in R_1$.
\end{enumerate}

In a Levin reduction, the goal is to recover a witness for an instance of $L_1$ given a witness to an instance of $L_2$.
In the weak Levin reduction, there is no requirement that the original witness is recoverable.

\begin{lemma}
  $L_1 \leq_L L_2$ implies $L_1 \leq_m L_2$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The function $f$ is the necessary many-one reduction.
  First suppose $x \in L_1$.
  \begin{align*}
    x \in L_1 & \implies \exists w \colon (x, w) \in R_1 \\
    & \implies \exists w \colon (f(x), g(x, w)) \in R_2 \\
    & \implies \exists w' \colon (f(x), w') \in R_2 \\
    & \implies f(x) \in R_2
  \end{align*}
  Next suppose $f(x) \in L_2$.
  \begin{align*}
    f(x) \in L_2 & \implies \exists w' \colon (f(x), w') \in R_2 \\
    & \implies \exists w' \colon (x, h(x, w')) \in R_1 \\
    & \implies \exists w \colon (x, w) \in R_1 \\
    & \implies x \in L_1
  \end{align*}
  Thus $x \in L_1$ if and only if $f(x) \in L_2$.
\end{proof}

The weak Levin reduction is so named because it is a compromise between the Levin reduction and the many-one reduction.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:weaklevin}
  $L_1 \leq_L L_2$ implies $L_1 \leq_w L_2$ implies $L_1 \leq_m L_2$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $L_1 \leq_L L_2$.
  By the previous lemma, $L_1 \leq_m L_2$.
  The function $(x, w) \mapsto (f(x), g(x, y))$ proves that $R_1 \leq_m R_2$.
\end{proof}

Since the weak Levin reduction is a more fine-grained comparison than the many-one reduction, a weak Levin reduction from a harder problem to an easier problem has more severe implications than a many-one reduction between the same problems.
%% Let $(\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2)$ denote the class of all languages in $\mathcal{C}_1$ that have witness relations in $\mathcal{C}_2$.
There is a \emph{$(\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2)$ weak Levin reduction} from $L_1$ to $L_2$, denoted $L_1 \leq^{\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2}_w L_2$, if $L_1 \leq^{\mathcal{C}_1}_m L_2$ and $R_1 \leq^{\mathcal{C}_2}_m R_2$.
A $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C})$ weak Levin reduction is simply written as a \emph{$\mathcal{C}$ weak Levin reduction} and denoted $\leq^{\mathcal{C}}_w$.
%% A language $L$ with corresponding witness relation $R$ is $(\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{D}_1, \mathcal{D}_2)$-complete if $L \in (\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2)$, and for each language $L' \in (\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2)$, we have $L' \leq^{\mathcal{D}_1, \mathcal{D}_2}_w L$.

\begin{proposition}
  For any integer $d$ greater than 1,
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $\beta_2 \CSAT \leq_m^\L \beta_2 \NC^d \CSAT$, then $\bNC^d = \bP$.
  \item If $\beta_2 \CSAT \leq_w^\L \beta_2 \NC^d \CSAT$, then $\NC^d = \P$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

Here are two brief comments about this proposition.
First, this proposition extends to other levels of the beta hierarchy as well.
Second, the restriction that the reductions are computable in logarithmic space instead of polynomial time is not onerous: under $\leq_m^\L$ reductions, $\beta_2 \CSAT$ is complete for $\bP$ and $\beta_2 \NC^d \CSAT$ is complete for $\bNC^d$ (\todo{cite Sam H. here}).

\subsection{Complexity classes specifying verification complexity}

The complexity class $\GC(f(n), \mathcal{C})$ is the class of all languages $L$ for which there is a witness relation $R$ such that $x \in L$ if and only if there is a $w$ of length at most $O(f(n))$ such that $(x, w) \in R$ \autocite{cc97}.
This notation generalizes several other classes:
\begin{align*}
  \NP & = \cup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \GC(n^k, \P) \\
  \betaP & = \cup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \GC(\log^k n, \P) \\
  \betaNC & = \cup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \GC(\log^k n, \NC)
\end{align*}

Inclusions of complexity classes are preserved when adding nondeterminism.

\begin{lemma}
  For complexity classes $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$, if $\mathcal{C}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{C}_2$, then $\GC(f(n), \mathcal{C}_1) \subseteq \GC(f(n), \mathcal{C}_2)$.
\end{lemma}

The set of $\NP$-complete problems spans several of these ``guess-and-check'' classes.

\begin{lemma}
  \mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\ThreeSAT$ is $\NP$-complete and in $\GC(\poly, \AC^0)$.
  \item $\FSAT$ is $\NP$-complete and in $\GC(\poly, \NC^1)$.
  \item $\CSAT$ is $\NP$-complete and in $\GC(\poly, \P)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

Unfortunately, even specifying complexity classes in terms of verification complexity is not satisfactory, since $\NP = \GC(\poly, \P) = \GC(\poly, \NC^1)$ \autocite[Theorem~2.2]{wolf94}.
This puts $\FSAT$ and $\CSAT$ in the same class still.
We need a more fine-grained approach to comparing the complexity of problems based on their verification complexity.

\subsection{Completeness under weak Levin reductions}

We want to separate the satisfiability problem for circuits, formulas, and 3-CNF formulas.

\begin{theorem}
  \mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\CSAT$ is complete for $\GC(\poly, \P)$ under $\leq_w^{\P, \L}$ reductions.
  \item $\FSAT$ is complete for $\GC(\poly, \NC^1)$ under $\leq_w^{\P, \AC^0}$ reductions.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The following corollary essentially shows that $\NP$ is not closed under $\leq^L_w$ reductions unless $\NC = \P$.

\begin{corollary}
  \begin{equation*}
  \ThreeSAT \equiv_m^\L \FSAT \equiv_m^\L \CSAT
  %\end{equation*}
  \text{ and }
  %\begin{equation*}
    \ThreeSAT \leq_w^{\AC^0} \FSAT \leq_w^{\AC^0} \CSAT
  \end{equation*}
  but
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\FSAT \nleq_w^{\P, \AC^0} \ThreeSAT$ unless $\AC^0 = \NC^1$,
  \item $\CSAT \nleq_w^{\P, \L} \ThreeSAT$ unless $\NC = \P$,
  \item $\CSAT \nleq_w^{\P, \L} \FSAT$ unless $\NC = \P$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

In general, how can we construct a problem that is complete for a guess-and-check class under weak Levin reductions?
There are two strategies: start from a problem complete for $\GC(f(n), \mathcal{C})$ under many-one reductions and ensure that its witness relation is complete for $\mathcal{C}$ under many-one reductions, or start from a $\mathcal{C}$-complete witness relation and consider its projection onto its first component.
A third strategy is to choose a complete problem for $\mathcal{C}$ and define our complexity classes as the closure of that problem under weak Levin reductions; this is what happens in the next subsection.

\subsection{Classes respecting verification complexity}

We wish to determine complexity classes that are closed under weak Levin reductions.
Let $\cl(L, \leq)$ denote the class of all languages $\leq$-reducible to $L$, and let $\cl(\mathcal{C}, \leq) = \cup_{L \in \mathcal{C}} \cl(L, \leq)$.
(If $L$ is complete for $\mathcal{C}$ under $\leq$ reductions, then $\cl(\mathcal{C}, \leq) = \cl(L, \leq)$.)
For example,
\begin{align*}
  \NP & = \cl(\CSAT, \leq^\L_m) \\
  \NNC^d & = \cl(\NC^d \CSAT, \leq^\L_m) \\
  \NNC^1 & = \cl(\FSAT, \leq^{\AC^0}_m) \\[1ex]
  \bP & = \cl(\beta_2 \CSAT, \leq^\L_m) \\
  \bNC^d & = \cl(\beta_2 \NC^d \CSAT, \leq^\L_m) \\
  \bNC^1 & = \cl(\beta_2 \FSAT, \leq^{\AC^0}_m) \\[1ex]
  \P & = \cl(\CVP, \leq^\L_m) \\
  \NC^d & = \cl(\NC^d \CVP, \leq^\L_m) \\
  \NC^1 & = \cl(\FVP, \leq^{\AC^0}_m).
\end{align*}
For each of these complexity classes $\mathcal{C}$, we define $\mathcal{C}_w$ to be the closure under the appropriate resource-bounded weak Levin reduction instead of many-one reduction.
The closure under the weak Levin reduction is a subset of the closure under the many-one reduction, by \autoref{prop:weaklevin}.

%% \begin{align*}
%%   \NP_w & = \cl(\CSAT, \leq^\L_w) \\
%%   \NNC^d_w & = \cl(\NC^d \CSAT, \leq^\L_w) \\
%%   \NNC^1_w & = \cl(\FSAT, \leq^{\AC^0}_w) \\
%%   \bP_w & = \cl(\beta_2 \CSAT, \leq^\L_w) \\
%%   \bNC^d_w & = \cl(\beta_2 \NC^d \CSAT, \leq^\L_w) \\
%%   \bNC^1_w & = \cl(\beta_2 \FSAT, \leq^{\AC^0}_w) \\
%%   \P_w & = \cl(\CVP, \leq^\L_w) \\
%%   \NC^d_w & = \cl(\NC^d \CVP, \leq^\L_w) \\
%%   \NC^1_w & = \cl(\FVP, \leq^{\AC^0}_w).
%% \end{align*}

\begin{theorem}
  For each positive integer $d$ greater than one, $\NNC^1 = \NNC^d = \NP$, but
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item if $\NNC^1_w = \NNC^d_w$, then $\NC^1 = \NC^d$,
  \item if $\NNC^d_w = \NP_w$, then $\NC^d = \P$.
  \item if $\NNC^1_w = \NP_w$, then $\NC^1 = \P$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  $\NNC^1 = \NP$ by \autocite[Theorem~2.2]{wolf94}.
  If $\NNC^1_w = \NNC^d_w$, then $\NC^d \CVP \leq_m^{\AC^0} \FVP$, so $\NC^d \CVP$ is in $\NC^1$.
  If $\NNC^d_w = \NP_w$, then $\CVP \leq_m^{\L} \NC^d \CVP$, so $\CVP$ is in $\NC^d$.
  if $\NNC^1_w = \NP_w$, then $\CVP \leq_m^{\AC^0} \FVP$, so $\CVP$ is in $\NC^1$.
\end{proof}

How do these compare with our traditional classes?

\begin{theorem}
  For each positive integer $d$ greater than one, if $\NNC^d_w = \NNC^d$, then $\NC^d = \P$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Since $\NP = \NNC^d$ by \autocite[Theorem~2.2]{wolf94} and $\NNC^d = \NNC^d_w$ by hypothesis, we have $\NP = \NNC^d_w$.
  Thus there is a logarithmic space weak Levin reduction from $\CSAT$ to $\NC^d \SAT$.
  This implies $\NC^d = \P$.
\end{proof}

\section{Limited nondeterminism}

Now consider the tournament dominating set problem: given a tournament, decide whether it has a dominating set of size at most $k$.
Each tournament has a dominating set of size at most $\log n$, so the parameter $k$ must be bounded above by $\log n$.
Thus the problem can be solved by the following algorithm: given a tournament with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, nondeterministically choose a subset $S$ of $V$ of cardinality $k$ and decide whether for each $v$ in $V$ there is a $u$ in $S$ such that $(u, v) \in E$.
This algorithm chooses $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits and verifies whether the chosen set is a dominating set by an $\AC^0$ circuit computing
$$
\bigwedge_{v \in V} \bigvee_{u \in S} (u, v) \in E.
$$
Thus the problem is in $\bAC^0$.
A similar algorithm applies when deciding whether a graph has a clique of size at most $O(\log n)$: nondeterministically choose a candidate clique $S$ then decide whether
$$
\bigwedge_{u \in S} \bigwedge_{v \in S} (u, v) \in E,
$$
again a $\bAC^0$ algorithm.

Since the tournament dominating set problem and the logarithmically bounded clique problem are $\LOGSNP$-complete, and each is in $\bAC^0$, and $\bAC^0 \subseteq \bNC^2$, and the problems are actually complete for $\LOGSNP$ under $\L$ ($\NC^1$?) man-one reductions, and logarithmic space functions compose, and $\L \in \NC^2$, we have $\LOGSNP \subseteq \bNC^2$.
TODO Is $\LOGNP$ in there more generally?
TODO Show how the consequences of $\P = \LOGSNP$ compare with the consequences of $\P = \bNC^2$.
TODO Show a NCPCP algorithm for tournament dominating set.
TODO Adapt FO[polylog] definition of NC to $\bNC$.

\section{Combining limited nondeterminism and reductions respecting verification}

Here, we wish to show that for classes like $\LOGSNP$ and classes like $\APX$, these reductions can be used when showing completeness to further classify the complexity of these problems, while still demonstrating the comparison due to many-one reductions.
